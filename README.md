# FunctionalChess

This project started off as an interactive Tic Tac Toe game using the MiniMax algorithm from John Von Neumann's Game Theory. 
This project slowly and methodically transformed into an interactive chess game, using the algorithm Alpha-Beta to increase 
speed and efficiency. Programmed using VIM, on Byobu.
